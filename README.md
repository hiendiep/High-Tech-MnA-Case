## 4. Timeline
**Start to End:** Feb 2024 – March 2024

## 5. Scope of Work
- Evaluate the feasibility of IBM acquiring Equinix versus Megaport to enhance its cloud infrastructure capabilities, focusing on financial valuation, synergies, and strategic fit.  
- Analyze industry trends in IT spending and cloud adoption to contextualize the acquisition decision.  
- Propose an alternative solution (Megaport acquisition) that aligns with IBM’s financial constraints and strategic goals, avoiding capital-intensive infrastructure investments.  

## 6. Process and Approach

**Input:**  
- Financial data (e.g., Bloomberg Terminal)  
- Industry reports (e.g., IDC IT spending forecasts)  
- Company-specific data (e.g., financial statement, Form 10-K)

**Output:**  
- Valuation analysis (multiples and DCF)  
- Feasibility assessment  
- Alternative solution recommendation

**Process and Features:**  
- **Industry Analysis:** Assess global IT spending trends, focusing on cloud transformation and hybrid multi-cloud adoption, to identify strategic opportunities for IBM (e.g., 20% YoY increase in cloud infrastructure demand in 2024).  
- **Valuation Modeling:** Perform multiples and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation to determine Equinix’s overvaluation (10.2%) and required premium (46%), and Megaport’s acquisition premium (27%).  
- **Feasibility Analysis:** Evaluate financial feasibility (e.g., EPS dilution of 14% for Equinix, affordability of Megaport buyout), ownership structure challenges (e.g., Equinix’s anti-takeover provisions, REIT disqualification), and antitrust risks.  
- **Alternative Solution:** Propose acquiring Megaport to enhance IBM’s Direct Link service and global interconnectivity without capital-intensive infrastructure, leveraging Megaport’s 800+ data centers and Software Defined Network (SDN) platform.  

## 7. Outcome
- Equinix acquisition is **not recommended** due to overvaluation (10.2%), high premium (46%), significant EPS dilution (14%), ownership challenges, and antitrust concerns.  
- Megaport acquisition is **preferable**, requiring a 27% premium, aligning with IBM’s financial capabilities, and enhancing Direct Link service accessibility across 800+ global data centers.  
- IBM’s existing Australian operations (e.g., 4 data centers, SXiQ acquisition) can integrate with Megaport’s strengths for regional and global expansion.  

## 8. My Role
**Team Lead, Strategist, Financial Analyst:**  
- Analyze Equinix and colocation market, perform DCF valuation for Equinix  
- Conduct multiple valuation for Equinix, IBM, and Megaport  
- Conduct feasibility analysis for the case  

## 9. Lessons Learned
- Deep understanding of M&A valuation techniques (multiples, DCF) and their application in strategic decision-making.  
- Insights into cloud infrastructure trends and their impact on IT spending and corporate strategy.  
- Practical skills in assessing acquisition feasibility, including financial, legal (e.g., antitrust), and structural (e.g., ownership) considerations.
